Introduction
=============

Based on SiLA. A mission to establish international standards in laboratory automation and to create open connectivity.
Goals are interoperability, flexibility, resource optimization for laboratory instrument integration and software
services based on standardized communication protocls an d content specifications. Open standard. Cost efficient.
Based on well established communication protocols (Http2, gRPC). For more information visit the SiLA website or check
out  their repository on GitLab.

SiLA is based on an inherent server-client architecture. Connection is established over a TCP/IP network.
SiLA servers and client

SiLA uses auto-discovery to broadcast services on the network. Accessing, managing and integrating these services
into workflows in the lab environment is not part of the SiLA standard. A software framework is needed to connect and
manage available lab devices.
