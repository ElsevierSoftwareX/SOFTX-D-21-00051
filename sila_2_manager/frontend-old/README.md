## Install

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Run `npm install` from inside this directory to install all dependencies. Optionally you can install Angular/Cli globally by running
   `npm install -g @angular/cli` to use the ng command directly

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start a angular dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run-script ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
